# Bernina High Level Workings

Now that we have the basics of the serial protocol understood, we can build code that reads an area of memory, writes at a location and we have this load (?) operation. You can build a low-level stack in code that will do all that and we now need to figure out the high level workings of the machine.

## Machine Name, Language & Version

N200100 --> "NMMV03.01·English     ·Bernina Electronic  AG  ·July 98"

Reading memory at 0x200100 will give you the machine firmware version. You also see the firmware language and manufacturer after this. It's a set of fixed length null terminated strings.

## Startup Sequence

This sequence is performed when you first enter the software and reads the BIOS version and the name of all of the embroidery files. The user will then be presented with a list of file that they can preview or download. The preview and download flows will be covered later.

(Start)
R57FF80 --> B4A5000020DF002B797D03700FCE0C08535332FF0370FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

N200100 --> "NMMV03.01·English     ·Bernina Electronic  AG  ·July 98"
    This read gets the firmware version of the machine. It's done very early. You can use a short "R" command to get just the version number, "NMMV03.01" but using the "N" command gets you the Version, Language, Manufacturer and Firmware date.
