# High Level Protocol

Now that we have the basics of the serial protocol understood, we can build code that reads an area of memory, writes at a location. You can build a low-level stack in code that will do all that and we now need to figure out the high level workings of the machine.

The machine uses the EXP format internally:
https://www.appropedia.org/EXP_Embroidery_File_Format
https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Embroidery_format_EXP

I noticed that the EXP files normally end with 0x8081 which is code to "Stop". If a EXP file does not end with this, the software will add it at the end of the file before uploading to the machine. It will then remove the ending 0x8081 when downloading and saving the file. We probably want to make sure the 0x8081 is present when updating to the machine.

## List Files in Internal Memory

This sequence is performed when you first enter the software and reads the BIOS version and the name of all of the embroidery files. It will read both read-only and read/write files. The user will then be presented with a list of file that they can preview or download. The preview and download flows will be covered later.

- Delect the baud rate the connect to the machine, uses RF? for detection, `TrMEJ05` to change baud rate.
- Check if in embroidery mode and change to it , uses `R57FF80` and `TrMEYQ`.
- Read the embroidery module firmware version, uses `N200100`.

- Peforms this unknown read
```
R024004 --> 00000000004B0000000000000000000000000000004B00000000000000000000
```

- Check if a PC Card is in the slot, 0x82 = No PC Card, 0x83 = Yes, card present.
```
RFFFED9 --> 8300330000000000000000000000000200000100000000000000000000000000  <- PC Card Present
            8200000000000000000000000000000200000100000000000000000000000000  <- No PC Card
```

Read the pointer to the block allocation array. We see 0x0206A0 is the location of the block vector.
```
R024040 --> 000206A000020764000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Read allocation of blocks (?), we see 0305 and the 03 is the number of user (Mx) files.
This likely indicates how much space is currently allocated, total and free.

The 3rd byte (0x2A) is the number of read only files
The 4th byte is the number of user files


```
R0206A0 --> 1D1B2A0380002C070200000305000000FFFFFF00FC6000000000000000000000

- Select if you want to read from the Embroidery Module Memory or PC Card
    - Invoke function 0x00A1 with no arguments to read from Embroidery Module Memory.
    - Invoke function 0x0051 with no arguments to read fro PC Card.

When calling function A1, you will see 0x63 show up at the 12th position in the RFFFED0, this may indicate the internal memory is currently selected. This 0x63 does not show up before calling 0x00A1 and does not show up before or after calling 0x0051.

WFFFED000A1? --> Write 00A1 to FFFED0

## Read Files from Embroidery Modules Memory (Details)

Here is an example startup sequence in more detail

```
(Start)
(Check that we are in embroidery mode)
R57FF80 --> B4A5000020DF002B797D03700FCE0C08535332FF0370FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

(Read the embroidery module firmware version)
N200100 --> "NMMV03.01·English     ·Bernina Electronic  AG  ·July 98"
    This read gets the firmware version of the machine. It's done very early. You can use a short "R" command to get just the version number, "NMMV03.01" but using the "N" command gets you the Version, Language, Manufacturer and Firmware date.

(Don't know what this is)
R024004 --> 00000000004B0000000000000000000000000000004B00000000000000000000

The following 6 reads, read a bunch of data before the main file. It could be searching for "40 8A 00 00 01 3C 80 02 0F 4D" which marks the start of the file. The file is 16838 bytes long or 0x41C6 in length.

Interesting: 0x408A + 0x013C = 0x41C6, the exact length of the file. The file could have multiple parts!

It looks like the first 0x408A bytes are the exact .EXP file format that is compatible with InkScape. This is great news as we can import and export right into a modern open source software. The remaining 0x013C bytes looks like extracted instructions that the machine will follow, this part has to be figured out.

This address 0x028E98 looks fixed, hard coded.

This is the extra data, Length: 316 bytes which includes 8 bytes at the front that has the length in small-endian. The H8 architecture employs big-endian byte ordering so, it's likely this data is not being used by the embroidery module.

The header writes starts at 0x028E98 with 0x0359 (857) - I don't know what that is.
We write the length of the file 0x00001136 at 0x028F40
We write the length of the extra data at 0x0000013C at (0x028F40 + 4)
We write the file data at (0x028F40 + 8) that 4406 bytes
We write 8 zero bytes at 0x024500
We write the preview data at 0x024508

There are 2 mistery values.
  - The first 2 bytes right at the start of the first write.
  - The write value to 0x02409D, sometimes it's 0x00 to 0x08?

We write the preview image in a different file starting at 0x024480
  - Write the header which is 174 bytes.
    - Write 0x0000093E (2366) this could indicate the type of the preview, 72x62 black & white.
    - Write 0xFF
    - Write 0x00 169 times.

## Create the Main Upload Block

In SerialStack.cs, I want to create a new method called "CreateMainDataBlock" that takes a EmbroideryFile and returns a byte[].

 - The 2 first bytes is (EmbroideryFile.FileData.length / 5) in network byte order.
 - Write 166 null characters
 - The next 4 bytes are the length EmbroideryFile.FileData.length in network byte order.
 - The next 4 bytes are the length EmbroideryFile.FileExtraData.length in network byte order, put 0x00000000 is FileExtraData is empty of null.
 - Write the entire EmbroideryFile.FileData
 - Write the entire EmbroideryFile.FileExtraData if present.

Note that EmbroideryFile.FileData must not be null and not be empty. The resulting byte[] size must be 176 bytes + EmbroideryFile.FileData.length + EmbroideryFile.FileExtraData.length. Double check this before exit.

## Create the Image Preview Upload Block

In SerialStack.cs, I want to create a new method called "CreatePreviewDataBlock" that takes a EmbroideryFile and returns a byte[].

 - Write 0x0000093EFF as the first 5 bytes in network byte order
 - Write 0x00 169 times.
 - Write the preview image EmbroideryFile.PreviewImageData

Note that EmbroideryFile.PreviewImageData must not be null and not be empty. The resulting byte[] size must be 174 bytes + EmbroideryFile.PreviewImageData.length. Double check this before exit.

## Create the Upload Method

In SerialStack.cs, I want to create a new method that will write a file to the embroidery module using the serial port. The method header looks like this:

        public async Task<bool> WriteEmbroideryFileAsync(EmbroideryFile file, StorageLocation location, Action<int, int>? progress = null)

This method will start looking a lot like ReadEmbroideryFileAsync() we do the following:

 - Use CreateMainDataBlock() to create the "main data block"
 - Use CreatePreviewDataBlock() to create the "preview data block"
 - Check that we are connected
 - Check that we are not busy
 - Set busy state
 - Ensure we are in embroidery mode, if not, change to embroidery mode.
 - If the location is PC Card, check if a PC card is present.
 - Do a protocol reset
 - Select the storage source (Embroidery Module or PC Card)
 - Write the "main data block" to 0x028E98
 - Write the "preview data block" to 0x024480
 - Write 0x01 to 0x02409D, write a comment that this is a block size value and may be changed in the future.
 - Write 0xA4 to 0x0240B9.
 - Write the filename to 0x0240D5. We must pad the data with 0x00 so that it's 32 bytes long. The file name can't be more than 31 bytes long in UTF-8.
 - Invoke method 0x0201. Put a 4 second wait on the method invocation for the machine to have time to store the data.

If everything is a success, return true.
